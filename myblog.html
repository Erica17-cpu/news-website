        <p>Life as a university student is a mix of excitement, challenges, and self-discovery. It’s a time of juggling classes, assignments, and exams while trying to build friendships and explore new interests. Balancing academics with social life and sometimes part-time work can be overwhelming, but it teaches resilience and independence. Every day offers a chance to learn—not just from books, but from the people and experiences that shape your journey.</p>
